The CompTIA CySA+ (CS0-003) exam is designed for cybersecurity professionals who are on the front lines of defense, actively monitoring and combating threats against their organization's networks. This intermediate-level certification validates the skills needed to not only detect and analyze indicators of malicious activity but also to effectively use tools for vulnerability and incident response. The exam consists of a maximum of 85 questions, including a mix of multiple-choice and performance-based questions, and candidates are given 165 minutes to complete it. A passing score of 750 on a scale of 100-900 is required to earn the certification.

The CS0-003 exam is structured around four key domains, each weighted to reflect its importance in the role of a cybersecurity analyst:

- **Security Operations (33%):** This domain focuses on the practical aspects of managing security, including the use of security tools, threat intelligence, and implementing security controls.
- **Vulnerability Management (30%):** Candidates are tested on their ability to identify and manage vulnerabilities in systems and networks, a critical component of a proactive security posture.
- **Incident Response and Management (20%):** This section covers the procedures and techniques for responding to and recovering from security incidents.
- **Reporting and Communication (17%):** A crucial, yet often overlooked skill, this domain assesses the ability to effectively report on security findings and communicate with stakeholders.
